This is my 2D project for COSC 482 at Salisbury University.

The user controls a robot that gets dropped into a randomly generated world and has to dig through the terrain to find minerals.
Most of the graphical code boilerplate stuff was abstracted from the "game engine" I built throughout the semester.
